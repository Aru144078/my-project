Live Character Counter for Textarea

Task Description :

Add a textarea input field where the user can type text.
Place a character counter element below or beside the textarea.
As the user types, the character counter updates instantly, showing the exact number of characters typed.
If the user deletes characters, the counter decreases accordingly.


Expected Output :

When the user types text, the counter dynamically increases.
When the user deletes text, the counter decreases.
Example:
Input: "Hello" → Character Counter shows 5.
Input: "Hello World!" → Character Counter shows 12.
The counter always reflects the current text length inside the textarea.
