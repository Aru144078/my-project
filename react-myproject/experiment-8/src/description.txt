BREAKDOWN OF app.jsx fle 
Purpose:
React component App implements a Library Management System.
Functionalities:

Search books by title.
Add new books (title + author).
Remove existing books.
Uses React useState hook for state management.

Functions:

1.	addBook()
Purpose: Adds a new book {title, author} into the books array.

Valid input:
title and author are non-empty strings
Example: "Python Basics", "Guido van Rossum"

Invalid input:
Empty title or author (""), null, or undefined
Example: title="", author="" → Book is not added.

2.removeBook(index)
Purpose: Removes the book at the specified index from the books array.

Valid input:
Index within range [0, books.length - 1]

Invalid input:
Index out of bounds → JavaScript error (rare, UI prevents it).

3. filteredBooks
Purpose: Filters books whose title includes search string (case-insensitive)

Valid input:
Any string in search → shows matching books

Invalid input:
None; empty string returns all books.


BREAKDOWN OF APP.CSS FILE:

A)Purpose:
Provides basic styling for the Library Management UI.
Makes inputs, buttons, and book list visually appealing.
Hover effect on buttons improves UX.

Center align content, padding, font-family
2) input:

Do not edit manually unless you are adding new packages.


we haven't edit the main.jsx and index.html files they are same as in the default syntax is there .

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1)Learned how to create a functional component (App.jsx) in React.

3)Learned to manage dynamic data (books list, input fields, search) using React’s useState hook.
4)Practiced updating state for adding, removing, and filtering data.
5)Learned to create a basic CSS file (App.css) and apply it to a component.
6)Learned to install dependencies (npm install) and run the development server (npm run dev).
